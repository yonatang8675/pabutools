        project : :py:class:`~pabutools.election.instance.Project`
            The candidate project p to test instability for.
        leftover_budgets : dict[int, Numeric]
            Leftover budget per voter, as returned by

        voters_by_leftover : list[int] or None
            All voters pre-sorted by leftover ascending.  When provided the
            function filters this list to O_p(X) in O(n) instead of sorting

            The approval profile, one ballot per voter.
        current_solution : :py:class:`~pabutools.rules.budgetallocation.BudgetAllocation`
            The current EES solution. Its
            :py:attr:`~pabutools.rules.budgetallocation.BudgetAllocation.details` attribute
            must be an :py:class:`EESAllocationDetails` holding per-voter payments.

    Returns
    -------
        Numeric
            Minimum per-voter budget increase d > 0 such that the current
            solution is unstable for E(b + n·d). Returns ``float('inf')``
            when the solution is stable for every finite budget increase.

    Completion of EES via add-opt (§4.2, Corollary 4.7).

    Iteratively runs EES with increasing virtual per-voter budgets until
    the outcome is exhaustive (no project can certify instability).
    Returns the budget-feasible outcome with the highest total spending.

    Parameters
    ----------
        instance : :py:class:`~pabutools.election.instance.Instance`
            The instance containing the projects and the budget limit.
        profile : :py:class:`~pabutools.election.profile.approvalprofile.AbstractApprovalProfile`
            The approval profile, one ballot per voter.

    -------

            The completed EES outcome — a feasible outcome whose total cost
